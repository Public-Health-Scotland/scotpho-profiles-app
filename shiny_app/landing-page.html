            <h4>Profiles Tool Redesign</h4>
            <p>Following user feedback ScotPHO have redesigned this online profiles tool.The new design simplifies navigation between different visualisations and over time will allow us to introduce additional visualisations such as indicator splits by variables such as age, sex and ethnicity.  The changes will also enable ScotPHO to respond to requests for additional profiles. <a href="https://www.scotpho.org.uk/comparative-health/profiles/online-profiles-tool/">Further details</a> of the new features and additional user guidance are available.

         <h4>New Mental Health Profile for Adults</h4>
         <p>The Mental Health Profile for Adults is the result of Public Health Scotland's 
         <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/health-and-wellbeing/prevention-of-mental-ill-health-and-improved-wellbeing/mental-health-indicators/overview/">Mental Health Indicators project</a>
         The mental health indicators include measures of mental health outcomes, as well as of a wide range of interconnected determinants (risk factors and protective factors) of these outcomes. ScotPHO have recently published this profile for indicators in adults and are currently working on the profile for children and young people.
